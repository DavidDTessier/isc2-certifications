1. What is the main purpose of a primary key in a database table?

    * selected from candidate keys to identify data.
    * Only one primary key per table.

2. What is polyinstantiation?
    
    * occurs when two or more rows in the same relational database table appear to have identical primary keys but contain different data for use at different classification levels
    * often used as a defense against some types of interfence attacks
    * introduces additional storage costs* technique use to prevent unauthorized users from determining classified information by noticiing the absense of information 

3. Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning

   * supervised uses labelled data for training
   * unsupervised uses unlabelled data for training
