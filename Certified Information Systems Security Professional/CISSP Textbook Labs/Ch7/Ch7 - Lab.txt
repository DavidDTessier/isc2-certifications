1. Explain the process Bob should use if he wants to send a confidential message to Alice using asymmetric cryptography
   * Leveraging a Public Key Exchange (Diffie-Hellman)
   * Bob will generate a public and private key pair and will share the public key with Alice 
   * Alice will generate a public and private key pair and will share her public key with Bob
   * Bob will encrypt the message using Alice's public key and send the encrypted message to Alice

2. Explain the process Alice would use to decrypt the message Bob sent in Q1
    * Alice will use her own private key to decrypt the message Bob sent since it was encrypted with Alice's public key 

3. Explain the process Bob should use to digitally sign a message to Alice
    * Bob will uses his private key to generate a digital signature using a hash function and append it to the message it. He Bob wants to maintain confidentiality he will encrypt the entire message including the digital signature with Alice's public key. 

4. Explain the process Alice should use to verify the digital signature on the message from Bob in Q3
    * If the full message is encrypted Alice would decrypt it using her own private key
    * she would then verify the digital signature by using Bob's public key and hashing the public key to compare the hash values she generate to the digital signature
    * if both hashes match the she can verify that Bob sent the message
