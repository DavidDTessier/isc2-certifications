1. Name at least seven security models and primary security benefits of using each

    * Trusted Computing Base (TCB)
        * combination of hardware, software, and controls work together to a for a trust union to enforce security policies
    * (Secure State Machine Model)
        * ensures a system remains secure throughout all its operations by defining all possible system states and transitions between them
    * Information Flow
        * based on state machine model
        * focuses on controlling the movement of data and access to and from it
    * Noninterference
        * loosely based on the Information Flow Model
        * more concerned on making sure the actions of subjects at a higher level do not affect the system state or actions of subjects a lower levels
    * Take-grant
        * controls the passage of rights to subjects
    * Access Control matrix
        * provides a perspective of access on multiple objects across mutilple objects
    * Bell-LaPadula 
        * build  for the DoD
        * protects confidentiality
    * Biba
        * protects integrity
    * Clark-Wilson
        * protects integrity 
    * Brewer-Nash
        * avoids conflicts of interest

2. Describe the primary components of TCB.
    * Security Perimeter
        * bounds between the TCB and the rest of the system
        * prevents insecure communications between TCB and the rest of the system
        * Has Trusted Paths
    * Reference Monitor
        * validates access to every resource
        * grants access to resources
        * stands between the subject and object
    * Security Kernel
        * implements the reference monitor
        * launches components that enforce the reference monitor
        * uses trusted paths to communicate
        * mediates all resource access 

3. What are the two primary rules or principles of the Bell-LaPadula security model? Also what are the two rules of Biba?

4. What is the difference between open and closed systems and open and closed source?
    * closed systems are typically proprietary in nature with unpublished protocols and are less likely to be targetted by attackers
    * closed source is source code that is hidden from public, vendor maintains it, sometime is commerical in nature, could still be an open system
    * open source is source code that is available to the public and leverages the public to review to make it more secure and stable
    * open system built on agreed-upon industry standards, easily integrates with other systems but is more susceptible to being targeted by attackers

5. Name at least four design principles and describe them?
    * security should be considered at every stage of a system's development
    * avoid transitive trust between systems
    * decide either close vs open system 
    * handle system errors in a 
    * KISS principle
