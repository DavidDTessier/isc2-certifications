1. Name three types of ICSs and describe what they do or how they are used.
    * Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)
        * single-purpose or focused-purpose digital computational units
        * deployed for managing and automating various industrial operations
            * such as controlling systems on an assembly line
    * Distributed Controls Systems (DCSs)
        * industrial access point gathering data and implementing control over a large-scale environment
    * Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
        * even driven 
        * includes a human-machine interface for users to oversee, control, and managed the entire system
       
2. Name the three pairs of aspects or features used to describe storage.
    * 
    
3. Name some vulnerabilities found is distributed architectures
    * Interconnectedness of the components allows for error & malware propogation 
    * unauthorized user access
    * Communication eavesdropping
    * Masquerading/spoofing attacks
    * failure to enforce accountability

4. There are numerous server-based technologies that both increase computation and resource access capabilities and also introduce new risks to be manage. Name at least 10 examples of these technologies (over 20 were included in this chapter)
