1. Describe the differences between transport and tunnel mode of VPNs 
  * transport
    * does not encrypt header only payload
  * tunnel
    * encrypts for header and payload
    * encapsulates entire 

2. Discuss benefits of NAT 
  * leveraging private IPs for internal networks and still be able to communicate to the internet
  * allows simultaneous connections over a single IP 


3. What are the main differences between circuit switching and packet switching?

  * packet switching 
    * message is split into small segments
    * sent over network on best path and not an exclusive path
    * conncetionless
    * sensitive to data loss
  * cicuit switching
    * fix / dedicated path
    * used of voice (PSTN)
    * sensitive to connect loss

4. What are some security issues with email and options for safeguarding against them?
   * susceptible to delivery of malicious content (trojans, malicious files, viruses)
   * susceptible to source address spoofing
   * Email header modification 
   * Mail Bombing / Storm
   * Controls
     * digital signed messages
     * spam filters
     * DKIM
     * Sender Policy Framework / DMARC
    
5. What are the private IP address, APIPA addresses, and loopback addresses?
   * Private IP Address (RFC 1918)
     * Class A: `10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255`
     * Class B: `172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255`
     * Class C: `192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255`
   * APIPA 
     * 169.254.1.0 - 169.254.255.255
   * Loop Back
     * 127.x.x.x
     * 127.0.0.1 --> typical
    
6. Name at least six facts about VLANs

  * control and restrict broadcast traffic
  * provides traffic isolation
  * cross vlan functionality requires routing (either using a router or built in to switch)
  * assigned per port basis
  * does not enforce/imposed encryption (can occur within the VLAN)
  * reduces the vulnerability of packet sniffers
