1. Describe the difference between TCP SYN scanning and TCP connect scanning
  * TCP SYN scanning
    * sends a single packet to each scanned port with the SYN flag
    * indicates a request to open a new connection
    * if scanner receives a response that has the SYN and ACK flags set, this indicates that the system is moving to the second phase in the TCP handshake and that the port is open
    * aka "half-open" or "stealth" scanning
  * TCP Connect scanning
    * opens a full connection
    * used when the user running the scan does not the necessary permissions to run a half-open scan
    * most other scans require the ability to send raw packets, and a user may be restricted by the OS from sending handcrafted packets

2. What are the five port status values returned by the Nmap network discovery scanning tool?

  * **Open**
    * port is open on the remote system and there is an application that is actively accepting connections on the port
  * **Closed**
    * port is accessible on the remote system, meaning that the firewall is allowing access, but there is no application accepting connections on that port
  * **Filtered**
    * nmap is unable to determine whether a port is open or closed because a fw is interfering with the connection attempt
  * **Unfiltered**
    * port is accessible, but nmap cannot determine whether it is open or closed
    * port is exposed to the packet probes sent by nmap, but no conclusive evidence can determine the port's status
  * **Open | Filtered** 
    * cannot establish whether the port is open or filtered
    * occurs when a port does not respond to Nmap's probes, which could be due to a packet filtering preventing nmap's requests from reaching the port, or the port is open but designed not to respond to the probes used by Nmap

3. What is the difference between static and dynamic code scanning/testing techniques?

   * static code testing
     * test code (not the running app)
     * may test a compiled binary
   * dynamic testing
     * tests the application in the wild running
     * used for black box testing

4. What is the difference between mutation fuzzing and generational fuzzing?

   * mutation fuzzing 
      * uses previous testing inputs but modified 
   * generational fuzzing 
     * data models that create new inputs based on the understanding of the data in the program
