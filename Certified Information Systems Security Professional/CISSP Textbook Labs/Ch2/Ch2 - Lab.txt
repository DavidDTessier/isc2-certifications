2. What are the basic formulas or values used in quantitative risk assessment?
    * Asset Value (AV) is the $ of an asset
    * Exposure Factor (EF) is the % of loss
    * Single loss expectancy (SLE) = AV * EF
    * Annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) is the # of occurrences / per year
    * Annualized lost expectancy (ALE) = SLE * ARO
    * Annualized Cost of the safeguard is the $ of the safeguard / per year
    * Value or benefit of a safeguard = (ALE1 (pre-safeguard) - AL2 (post-safeguard)) - ACS

3. Describe the process or techniques used to reach an anonymous consensus during a qualitative risk assessment.
    * anonymous consensus is the process of gaining / eliciting feedback from a group without identifying the individual participants with their response
    techniques

            * the process is repeated until consensus is achieved
        * Scenarios
    
4. Discuss the need to perform a balanced risk assessment. What are the techniques that can be used and why is this necessary?
    * Quantitative assessment assigns a dollar value to an asset
    * Qualitative assessment is subjective in nature and assigns intangible values to the loss of an asset and takes into account perspectives and feelings
    * Both can be used to enhance each other
