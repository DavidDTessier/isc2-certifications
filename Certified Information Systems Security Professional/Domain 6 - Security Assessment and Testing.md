# Domain 6 - Security Assessment and Testing

## 6.1 - Design and validate assessment, test, and audit strategies

* External (e.g., outside organization control)
* Third-party (e.g., outside of enterprise control)
* Location (e.g., on-premises, cloud, hybrid)

## 6.2 - Conduct security control testing

* Vulnerability assessment
* Penetration testing (e.g., red, blue, and/or purple team exercises)
* Log reviews
* Synthetic transactions/benchmarks
* Code review and testing
* Misuse case testing
* Coverage analysis
* Interface testing (e.g., user interface, network interface, application programming interface (API))
* Breach attack simulations
* Compliance checks

## 6.3 - Collect security process data (e.g., technical and administrative)

* Account management
* Management review and approval
* Key performance and risk indicators
* Backup verification data
* Training and awareness
* Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity (BC)

## 6.4 - Analyze test output and generate report

* Remediation
* Exception handling
* Ethical disclosure

## 6.5 - Conduct or facilitate security audits

* Internal (e.g., within organization control)
