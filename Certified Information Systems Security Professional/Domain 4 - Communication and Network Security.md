# Domain 4 - Communication and Network Security

## 4.1 - Apply secure design principles in network architectures

* Open System Interconnection (OSI) and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) models
* Internet Protocol (IP) version 4 and 6 (IPv6) (e.g., unicast, broadcast, multicast, anycast)
* Secure protocols (e.g., Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), Secure Shell (SSH), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/ Transport Layer Security (TLS))
* Implications of multilayer protocols
* Converged protocols (e.g., Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), InfiniBand over Ethernet, Compute Express Link)
* Transport architecture (e.g., topology, data/control/management plane, cut-through/store-and-forward)
* Performance metrics (e.g., bandwidth, latency, jitter, throughput, signal-to-noise ratio)
* Traffic flows (e.g., north-south, east-west)
* Physical segmentation (e.g., in-band, out-of-band, air-gapped)
* Logical segmentation (e.g., virtual local area networks (VLANs), virtual private networks (VPNs), virtual routing and forwarding, virtual domain)
* Micro-segmentation (e.g., network overlays/encapsulation; distributed firewalls, routers, intrusion detection system (IDS)/intrusion prevention system (IPS), zero trust)
* Edge networks (e.g., ingress/egress, peering)
* Wireless networks (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, satellite)
* Cellular/mobile networks (e.g., 4G, 5G)
* Content distribution networks (CDN)
* Software defined networks (SDN), (e.g., application programming interface (API), Software-Defined Wide- Area Network, network functions virtualization)
* Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
* Monitoring and management (e.g., network observability, traffic flow/shaping, capacity management, fault detection and handling)

## 4.2 - Secure network components

* Operation of infrastructure (e.g., redundant power, warranty, support)
* Transmission media (e.g., physical security of media, signal propagation quality)
* Network Access Control (NAC) systems (e.g., physical, and virtual solutions)
* Endpoint security (e.g., host-based)

## 4.3 - Implement secure communication channels according to design

* Voice, video, and collaboration (e.g., conferencing, Zoom rooms)
* Remote access (e.g., network administrative functions)
* Data communications (e.g., backhaul networks, satellite)
* Third-party connectivity (e.g., telecom providers, hardware support)
