## 4.1 Advocate training and awareness of application security

» Cloud development basics
» Common pitfalls
» Common cloud vulnerabilities (e.g., Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top-10, SANS Top-25)

## 4.2 Describe the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process

» Business requirements
» Phases and methodologies (e.g., design, code, test, maintain, waterfall vs. agile)

## 4.3 Apply the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

» Cloud-specific risks

» Threat modeling (e.g., Spoofing, Tampering,
Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of
Service, and Elevation of Privilege (STRIDE),
Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected
Users, and Discoverability (DREAD), Architecture,
Threats, Attack Surfaces, and Mitigations
(ATASM), Process for Attack Simulation and
Threat Analysis (PASTA))

» Avoid common vulnerabilities during
development

» Secure coding (e.g., Open Web Application
Security Project (OWASP) Application Security
Verification Standard (ASVS), Software Assurance
Forum for Excellence in Code (SAFECode))

» Software configuration management and
versioning

## 4.4 Apply cloud software assurance validation

» Functional and non-functional testing
» Security testing methodologies (e.g., blackbox, whitebox, static, dynamic, Software Composition Analysis
(SCA), interactive application security testing (IAST))
» Quality assurance (QA)
» Abuse case testing

## 4.5 Use verified secure software

» Securing application programming interfaces (API)
» Supply-chain management (e.g., vendor assessment)
» Third-party software management (e.g., licensing)
» Validated open-source software

## 4.6 Comprehend the specifics of cloud application architecture

» Supplemental security components (e.g., web application firewall (WAF), Database Activity Monitoring (DAM),
Extensible Markup Language (XML) firewalls, application programming interface (API) gateway)
» Cryptography
» Sandboxing
» Application virtualization and orchestration (e.g., microservices, containers)

## 4.7 Design appropriate identity and access management (IAM) solutions

» Federated identity
» Identity providers (IdP)
» Single sign-on (SSO)
» Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
» Cloud access security broker (CASB)
» Secrets management
