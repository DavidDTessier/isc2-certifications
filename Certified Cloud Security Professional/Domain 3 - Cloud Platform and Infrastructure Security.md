## 3.1 Comprehend cloud infrastructure and platform components

» Physical environment
» Network and communications
» Compute
» Virtualization
» Storage
» Management plane

## 3.2 Design a secure data center

» Logical design (e.g., tenant partitioning, access control)
» Physical design (e.g., location, buy or build)
» Environmental design (e.g., Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC),
multi-vendor pathway connectivity)
» Design resilient

## 3.3 Analyze risk associated with cloud infrastructure and platforms

» Risk assessment (e.g., identification, analysis)

» Risk mitigation strategies

## 3.4 Plan and implementation of security controls

» Physical and environmental protection (e.g.,
on-premises)
» System, storage and communication protection
» Identification, authentication and authorization
in cloud environments
» Audit mechanisms (e.g., log collection,
correlation, packet capture)

## 3.5 Plan business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR)

» Business continuity (BC) / disaster recovery (DR) strategy
» Business requirements (e.g., Recovery Time Objective (RTO), Recovery Point Objective (RPO),
recovery service level)
» Creation, implementation and testing of plan
